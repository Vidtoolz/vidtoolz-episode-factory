## Applied Defaults

## Unresolved Warnings

- none

## Manual Earth Studio Build Summary

- Use this plan as a manual camera-build guide.
- Use the coordinates in `shot-plan.json` for search or camera target reference.
- Use `route.kml` only as a visual reference asset.
- KML import does not create a finished Earth Studio camera animation.
- Mikko must manually create, review, adjust, and approve keyframes before rendering.
